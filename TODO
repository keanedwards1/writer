1. Add a piece of logic that allows users to remove placeholders (poems) they don't like
    and add poems that they want:
    There could be a page where people can vote on new poems that they like (user submitted)
    (They get added if a certain percentage of the user's vote for it)

2. Add a toggle to toggle between poem and prose prompts

3. search bar that has already preselected all the pages that are on the website, and maybe they can search through the poem database and user database.
